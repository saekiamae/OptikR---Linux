---

## Project Motivation

This is a **proof of concept** and a **one-person community project**.

**Built by someone with minimal coding experience** — I can understand code but can't write it from scratch. This project proves that with the right tools, determination, and community support, anyone can create something meaningful.

**Why I Built This:**
- Make translation accessible to everyone
- No paywalls, no subscriptions, no limits
- Community-driven development
- Learn by doing (and sharing what I learned)
- Give back to the community that helped me

**What This Means:**
- This is a proof of concept — expect rough edges
- Bugs exist but will be fixed
- Extensive documentation to help you understand and improve it
- Community contributions are welcome and encouraged
- It works, and it works well for what it does

## What is OptikR?

### A Modular Framework

OptikR is not just a screen translator — it's a **modular framework built on extensibility and plugins**. This is a proof of concept demonstrating what's possible when you combine:

- **Stage-Based Pipeline Architecture** — Every processing stage (Capture, OCR, Translation, Overlay) is plugin-based
- **Universal Plugin System** — Everything can be enhanced, replaced, or extended
- **Built-In Plugin Generator** — CLI tool creates correctly structured plugins for any type
- **Zero Limits Philosophy** — The only limit is your hardware, not the software

### Built for Everyone

**Accessibility First:**
- **Custom UI Languages** — Import your own language translations via Sidebar > Language Packs
- **Highly Customizable** — Every setting is user-configurable
- **No Artificial Limits** — You control everything
- **Community-Driven** — Share plugins, dictionaries, and translations

### Everything is a Plugin

**You Can Add:**
- New OCR engines (Mokuro, Windows OCR, custom models)
- New capture methods (DirectX, Screenshot, custom implementations)
- New translation engines (local AI, cloud APIs, custom models)
- New optimizer plugins (frame skip, caching, preprocessing)
- New text processors (spell check, regex filters)

### DEMO Video

**Plugin Generator Helps You:**

```bash
python run.py --create-plugin
```

Interactive CLI that generates the correct folder structure, `plugin.json`, entry script with template code, and a README for any plugin type. See [Plugins and Engines](docs/PLUGINS_AND_ENGINES.md) for full details.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.10+** — Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - During installation, check **"Add Python to PATH"**
2. **CUDA Toolkit (optional, recommended for NVIDIA GPUs)** — Download from https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
   - Install CUDA 12.x, then **restart your computer**
   - See [How To Run — CUDA section](docs/HOW_TO_RUN.md#cuda-toolkit--what-it-is-and-why-you-should-install-it) for details
3. **Visual C++ Redistributable (Windows)** — Download from https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

### Install and Run

```bash
cd OptikR
python run.py
```

That's it. On first launch, OptikR automatically:
1. Installs all dependencies from `requirements.txt`
2. Detects your GPU and installs the correct PyTorch build (CUDA or CPU)
3. Restarts itself once setup is complete

No manual `pip install` is required under normal conditions. If auto-install fails (network issues, permissions), see [How To Run](docs/HOW_TO_RUN.md) for manual installation steps.

### First Launch Setup

1. **Consent Dialog** — Accept the terms on first run
2. **Setup Wizard** — Guides you through initial configuration:
   - Select source and target languages
   - Choose OCR engine (EasyOCR recommended)
   - Choose translation engine (MarianMT for offline)
   - Download required AI models
3. **Start Translating**
   - Click "Select Region" to choose the area to translate
   - Click "Start" to begin real-time translation
   - Translations appear as overlays on your screen

### Troubleshooting Installation

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Python not found" | Reinstall Python with "Add to PATH" checked |
| "CUDA not found" (NVIDIA GPU) | Restart computer after CUDA install |
| "DLL load failed" | Install Visual C++ Redistributable, restart |
| `pip install` fails | Run `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`, retry |

## Smart Dictionary

The Smart Dictionary is one of OptikR's most powerful features — a personal translation database that learns, grows, and can be shared.

### How It Works

```
First Time:
  OCR detects "Hello" → AI translates to "Hallo" → Dictionary saves it

Next Time:
  OCR detects "Hello" → Dictionary: "Hallo" (instant, no AI needed)
```

### Key Capabilities

- **Instant Lookup** — Skips AI translation entirely for known text
- **Per Language Pair** — Separate dictionary files (e.g., `en_de.json.gz`, `ja_en.json.gz`)
- **Full Control** — Browse, edit, delete entries in the Dictionary Editor
- **Import/Export** — Share dictionaries with the community (JSON format)
- **Word Extraction** — Optionally breaks sentences into individual words on stop
- **Statistics** — Track entries, lookups, hit rate, and most-used translations
- **Cleaning Tools** — Remove OCR errors and low-confidence entries

### Real Performance Impact

| Scenario | Without Dictionary | With Dictionary (after learning) |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| Manga reading | AI processing every frame | 60-80% hit rate, instant lookups |
| Game UI | AI processing every frame | 70-90% hit rate (UI is repetitive) |
| Video subtitles | AI processing every frame | 50-70% hit rate |

### Community Sharing

Export your dictionary from the Smart Dictionary tab and share the JSON file. Others can import it to get instant access to thousands of pre-translated terms. Great for manga communities, game localization groups, and language learners.

## Pipeline Architecture

### Sequential Pipeline (Default)

Each stage completes before the next starts. Simple, stable, low memory.

```
Frame 1: CAPTURE → OCR → TRANSLATE → POSITION → OVERLAY
Then Frame 2 starts...
```

**Best for:** Most users, lower-end systems, debugging.

### Async Pipeline (Advanced)

Stages run in parallel on different frames simultaneously. Higher throughput.

```
Time 0ms:   Frame 1: CAPTURE
Time 8ms:   Frame 1: OCR        | Frame 2: CAPTURE
Time 16ms:  Frame 1: OCR        | Frame 2: OCR       | Frame 3: CAPTURE
Time 58ms:  Frame 1: TRANSLATE  | Frame 2: OCR       | Frame 3: OCR
Time 88ms:  Frame 1: OVERLAY ✓  | Frame 2: TRANSLATE | Frame 3: OCR
```

**Best for:** Quad-core+ CPUs, 8 GB+ RAM, users who need 30+ FPS.

### Comparison

| Metric | Sequential | Async |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Throughput | ~10 FPS | ~50 FPS |
| CPU Usage | Medium | High |
| Memory | ~2 GB | ~3-4 GB |
| Stability | Very High | High |
| Recommended | Most users | Power users |
